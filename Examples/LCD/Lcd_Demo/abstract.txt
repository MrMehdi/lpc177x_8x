@Example description:
	Purpose:
		  This example project describes how to test LCD module on LPC1788.		  
	Process:	
		  The NXP logos appear on the LCD and the LCD hardware cursor moves as the 
		  board moves(the acceleration sensor is used).  		

		  The LCD driver support all bpp values. The example tests with 2bpp, 16bpp and 24bpp (1 pixel can
		  take 3 or 4 bytes). Define the value of LOGO_BPP and BMP_BYTES_PP to determine the running mode.

		  The backlight of LCD can be adjust by turn left/right potentiometer.

		  This example shows basic use of I/O, interrupt and LCD controllers.
		  
		  This code is referenced from IAR source code.

@Directory contents:
	\EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files	
	 
	\app: Include main file, logo & cursor image
	\board: board config file
	\modules: include supported drivers for this example 
	
@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
			2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- 3.3VA_E	:ON
				- VREG		:ON
				- IO_E		:ON
				- PWR_SEL	:depends on power source selection
		(Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
						
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
				
Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 4: Run example, observe LCD display
		
		@Warning: Maybe J-LINK power source cannot supply enough power for LCD
